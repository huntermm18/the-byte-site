Break up the potatoes a bit by using a potato masher at this point. It helps thicken the soup and gives a nice texture, but still leaves some potato chunks. Lower stove heat. 4. Grate some cheddar cheese into the soup, stir until it's melted. Add cream or milk to the soup - maybe a cup, depending on how thick you want.",
